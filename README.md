# neuralnetwork
I believe I've reached the limit of a fully conected neural network. As such, I will create a new Convolution Neural Network in a new repo

Based on Sebastian Lague's Neural Network project.

Implementation of a "fully fledged" neural network as a way to study for Introduction to Deep Learning @TUM (I2DL)

# how to run
1 -update path files

2- run
```bash
./build/neuralnetwok
./build/draw
```
